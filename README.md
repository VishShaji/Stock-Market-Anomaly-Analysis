# Stock Market Anomaly Detection

## Executive Summary

This project focuses on detecting anomalies in stock market data using Z-scores of closing prices and trading volumes. By leveraging the Alpha Vantage API for data retrieval, we aim to identify unusual trading patterns that may indicate potential risks or opportunities for investors.

## Business Problem

In the volatile stock market, anomalies can signal significant events such as market manipulation, sudden price changes, or emerging trends. Identifying these anomalies in real-time can help investors make informed decisions, manage risks, and capitalize on opportunities. Traditional analysis methods may not effectively capture these anomalies, necessitating a more straightforward statistical approach.

## Methodology

The project employs the following steps:

1. **Data Retrieval**:
   - Use the Alpha Vantage API to obtain stock market data, including closing prices and trading volumes.

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Calculate Z-scores for the closing prices and trading volumes to identify anomalies.

3. **Anomaly Detection**:
   - Identify anomalies based on the calculated Z-scores for both closing prices and volumes.

4. ## Risk Assessment

- **Adjusted Close Risk**:

  $$
  \text{adj\_close\_risk} = \text{anomalies\_adj\_close.groupby('Ticker')['Z-score'].apply(\lambda x: \text{abs}(x).\text{mean}())}
  $$

- **Volume Risk**:

  $$
  \text{volume\_risk} = \text{anomalies\_volume.groupby('Ticker')['Z-score'].apply(\lambda x: \text{abs}(x).\text{mean}())}
  $$

- **Total Risk**:

  $$
  \text{total\_risk} = \text{adj\_close\_risk} + \text{volume\_risk}
  $$

- **Risk Rating**:

  $$
  \text{risk\_rating} = \frac{\text{total\_risk} - \text{total\_risk.min()}}{\text{total\_risk.max()} - \text{total\_risk.min()}}
  $$




## Skills

- **Programming Languages**: Proficient in Python for data analysis.
- **Libraries**: Familiarity with Pandas for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Data Analysis**: Ability to preprocess and analyze stock market data using statistical methods.

## Results & Business Recommendations

### Anomaly Detection Results

*Insert a brief description of the results and what they indicate about the stock market trends.*

### Risk Assessment Metrics

*Discuss the risk scores calculated and their implications for investors.*

Based on the findings, it is recommended that investors:

- Monitor identified anomalies closely to assess their impact on investment strategies.
- Consider using Z-score analysis as a straightforward method for real-time anomaly detection.
- Conduct further research on the causes of detected anomalies to enhance understanding and predictive capabilities.

## Next Steps

1. **Further Analysis**: Explore additional statistical methods for anomaly detection beyond Z-scores.
2. **Real-Time Implementation**: Develop a system for real-time anomaly detection using the Alpha Vantage API.
3. **User Training**: Create training materials for users to effectively interpret and act upon anomaly detection results.
4. **Expand Data Sources**: Consider incorporating alternative data sources (e.g., news sentiment analysis) to enrich the anomaly detection framework.
