Stock Market Anomaly Detection
Executive Summary
This project focuses on detecting anomalies in stock market data to identify unusual trading patterns that may indicate potential risks or opportunities. By leveraging various machine learning techniques, we aim to enhance decision-making processes for investors and financial analysts.
Business Problem
In the volatile stock market, anomalies can signal significant events such as market manipulation, sudden price changes, or emerging trends. Identifying these anomalies in real-time can help investors make informed decisions, manage risks, and capitalize on opportunities. However, traditional analysis methods may not effectively capture these anomalies, necessitating advanced techniques.
Methodology
The project employs the following steps:
Data Preprocessing:
Load stock market data from a CSV file.
Handle missing values and scale the data.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Visualize stock data trends and statistical properties.
Anomaly Detection Techniques:
Isolation Forest: Isolates anomalies based on feature selection.
One-Class SVM: Learns a decision function for novelty detection.
Local Outlier Factor (LOF): Measures local density deviation to identify outliers.
Model Training and Evaluation:
Train models and evaluate their performance using precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.
Anomaly Visualization:
Highlight detected anomalies on stock data plots.
Skills
Programming Languages: Proficient in Python for data analysis and machine learning.
Libraries: Familiarity with NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib.
Data Analysis: Ability to preprocess and analyze large datasets.
Machine Learning: Understanding of anomaly detection algorithms and their applications.
Results & Business Recommendations
The results of the anomaly detection models are illustrated in the following images:

Insert a brief description of the results and what they indicate about the stock market trends.
Model Performance Metrics
Discuss the performance metrics of the models and their implications for investors.
Based on the findings, it is recommended that investors:
Monitor identified anomalies closely to assess their impact on investment strategies.
Consider integrating anomaly detection tools into their trading systems for real-time analysis.
Conduct further research on the causes of detected anomalies to enhance understanding and predictive capabilities.
Next Steps
Further Model Optimization: Explore additional anomaly detection algorithms and fine-tune existing models for improved accuracy.
Real-Time Implementation: Develop a system for real-time anomaly detection in stock trading platforms.
User Training: Create training materials for users to effectively interpret and act upon anomaly detection results.
Expand Data Sources: Incorporate alternative data sources (e.g., news sentiment analysis) to enrich the anomaly detection framework.
